# Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network using NumPy. The network supports various activation functions, including sigmoid, linear, and softmax. It includes functionality for training the network using mean squared error (MSE) loss and making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
```
# Usage
## Data Preparation
The code generates synthetic data for two classes and splits it into training and testing sets.

mean_class1, std_class1 = 10, 0.1
mean_class2, std_class2 = 11, 0.2
num_samples = 100
class1_data = np.random.normal(mean_class1, std_class1, num_samples)
class2_data = np.random.normal(mean_class2, std_class2, num_samples)

X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test = get_ds(class1_data, class2_data)
