# Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network using Python and NumPy. The neural network supports various activation functions, including sigmoid, linear, and softmax. It includes functionality for training the network using mean squared error (MSE) loss and making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
